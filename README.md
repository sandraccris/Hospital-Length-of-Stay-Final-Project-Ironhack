**Project Goal**
<br>
This project was developed as part of the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp.
The goal of this project is to develop a supervised classification machine learning model that predicts the length of stay for patients who are scheduled for General Surgery Procedures. Hospital bed shortages have been a significant challenge in healthcare worldwide, exacerbated further by the impact of the Covid19 pandemic. Surgical procedures often face cancellations due to a lack of available beds to accommodate post-operative patients.
<br>
In this context, accurately predicting the length of stay for patients becomes crucial for hospitals and healthcare facilities. A reliable predictive tool can assist administrators and healthcare staff in managing bed capacity effectively. By having a better estimate of the length of stay, hospitals can optimize their bed and staff allocation, improve patient safety, and enhance overall financial and medical efficiency.

**Dataset**
<br>
VitalDB (Vital Signs DataBase) is an open Dataset from Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea containing perioperative clinical information, laboratory results and intraoperative monitoring parameters of 6,388 surgical patients (general, thoracic, urologic, and gynaecologic) who underwent routine or emergency surgery. 
The dataset includes 73 columns with Clinical parameters, 196 intraoperative monitoring parameters and 34 columns with Laboratory results parameters. 
For this project only data for General Surgical Patients was selected and used.
